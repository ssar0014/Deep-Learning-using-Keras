# Deep-Learning-using-Keras

This repository has 3 Jupyter notebooks. Each contains code which builds convolutional neural networks using Keras (TensorFlow backend) for image recognition.

## iris_classification.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for the recognition and classification of the famous iris dataset.

## keras_im_class_cfir10.ipynb
this notebook contains the code for the recognition and classification of the cifar-10 dataset using keras.

## keras_cifar10_deep_net.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for the recognition and classification of the cifar-10 dataset using a deeper neural net consisting of more layers.

## mnist_using_keras.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for the recognition and classification of handwritten digits from the mnist dataset.
